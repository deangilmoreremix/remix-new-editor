  # Multi-Tenant Storage System

  ## Overview
  Creates secure, scalable storage buckets for multi-tenant file management.
  Each tenant's files are isolated in their own folder path.

  ## Storage Buckets Created

  ### 1. tenant-assets (Private)
  Stores user-uploaded files and generated content.
  - Path structure: /{tenant_id}/{user_id}/{asset_type}/{filename}
  - Size limit: 100MB per file
  - File types: Images, videos, audio, documents
  - Access: Authenticated users in same tenant only

  ### 2. tenant-generations (Private)
  Stores AI-generated media outputs.
  - Path structure: /{tenant_id}/generations/{generation_id}/{filename}
  - Size limit: 500MB per file (large videos)
  - File types: Images, videos, audio
  - Access: Authenticated users in same tenant only

  ### 3. tenant-thumbnails (Public)
  Stores public thumbnails and preview images.
  - Path structure: /{tenant_id}/thumbnails/{resource_type}/{filename}
  - Size limit: 10MB per file
  - File types: Images only
  - Access: Public read, authenticated write

  ### 4. shared-content (Public)
  Stores publicly shared content via share links.
  - Path structure: /shared/{share_token}/{filename}
  - Size limit: 100MB per file
  - File types: Images, videos
  - Access: Public read, authenticated write

  ## Storage Policies (RLS)
  All buckets have Row-Level Security policies:
  - Users can only upload to their tenant's folders
  - Users can only read files from their tenant
  - Public buckets allow anonymous reads
  - Shared content accessible via token

  ## Storage Quotas
  Enforced at application level:
  - Free plan: 10GB total storage
  - Pro plan: 100GB total storage
  - Enterprise plan: 1TB+ total storage

  ## Important Notes
  - File paths include tenant_id for isolation
  - Storage usage tracked in assets table
  - Automatic cleanup for deleted resources
  - CDN-ready for fast delivery
