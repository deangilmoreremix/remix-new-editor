  # Create thumbnails and instructions tables

  1. New Tables
    - `thumbnails`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `target_type` (text) - either 'studio' or 'template'
      - `target_id` (text) - the studio or template slug id
      - `image_path` (text) - public file path to the thumbnail
      - `alt_text` (text) - accessibility description
      - `prompt_used` (text) - the AI generation prompt for reproducibility
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - when the thumbnail was generated

    - `instructions`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `studio_id` (text, unique) - the studio slug id
      - `title` (text) - display title for the studio
      - `steps` (jsonb) - array of step objects with number, heading, description
      - `quick_tips` (jsonb) - array of tip strings
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz) - last update timestamp

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on both tables
    - Add read-only policy for authenticated users on both tables
    - These are content tables managed by admins, users only need read access

  3. Indexes
    - Unique constraint on thumbnails(target_type, target_id)
    - Unique constraint on instructions(studio_id)
