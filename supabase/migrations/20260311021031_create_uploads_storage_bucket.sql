-- Create uploads storage bucket
--
-- 1. New Storage Bucket
--    - uploads: Public bucket for user-uploaded reference images and videos
--    - File size limit: 10MB
--    - Allowed MIME types: image and video formats
--
-- 2. Security
--    - Public read access so AI model endpoints can fetch uploaded files by URL
--    - Anonymous upload access since the app uses API keys (not Supabase Auth)
--    - Anonymous delete access for cleanup
--
-- 3. Notes
--    - This replaces the external API file upload endpoint that requires credits
--    - Files are stored with unique timestamped names to avoid collisions
